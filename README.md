What this project uses

CodeIgniter - The MVC framework

Google Maps API

CodeIgniter Google Maps V3 API Library located <a href="https://github.com/BIOSTALL/CodeIgniter-Google-Maps-V3-API-Library"> Here</a>


To install this app I used the MAMP default install, so all is that really needs to be done is to download the zip file unzip it into your htdocs folder, and then run the sql dump file to create the database tables and data.
